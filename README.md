# Premier League Player Ratings App
A web app that allows users to rate Premier League players based on their performance in each game. Users can submit their ratings and compare them with the average score of all users who have voted.

## TODO

### API Integration
Implement an API to retrieve real-time data for all Premier League matches.
Fetch details of all players who participated in each game.

### Database Setup
Design and implement a database to store player ratings, game details and user data.

### Authentication
Implement a user authentication system to allow users to create accounts and save their ratings.
Maybe OAuth

### Backend Development
Set up a backend server to manage API requests, user authentication, and data storage.
